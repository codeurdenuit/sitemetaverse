  infoText: `Through my projects, I try to share a vision.
  For me, code is a creative tool. 
  It lets you produce service applications, but it also lets you create universes and experiences.
  
  I'm trying to develop a community to share my creations and find support for my future projects.

  If you think you have an innovative and creative project (2D, 3D, VR), feel free to contact me by email or twitter.. (codeurdenuit@gmail.com)
  I'm often busy, but I'm pleasure to supporting projects in line with my vision.
